# Timesheets
 A program that can keep track of working hours of employees. By logging start- and end-times the program is able to determine how long the employee has worked, en at what times the employee has clocked in and out.

 ```
 This program is not intended to be used by real businesses. 
 This is just a fun project I've been working on and is not meant to be used in practise.
 ```

## Getting Started

The application can be downloaded as a .jar file from the build folder. The application can then be launched by opening a command line and typing:
```
java -jar Timesheets.jar
```
## Prerequisites

The program is built in Java 8. In order for the application to work, a working installation of Java version 8 or higher is therefore necessary.
